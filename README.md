# WorksInProgress
Basically nothing in here is working properly.  But I needed someway to move it between my day job and working-from-home section of the job.  See comments in individual files for desription of what they are suppose to do, but probably fail at doing, miserably in some cases.
After they actually work they get moved into their respective categories.
In general this folder is for working projects done only by myself, collaborative works in progress are housed elsewhere.
